Pentago
Functions: 
rotate: 
	Rotates a block of the grid
Params: 
	@grid: the current grid
	@move: the rotation move
Return:
	grid after rotation
	copyGrid: 
		shallow copies a grid into a new variable without mutation the original grid
		Params:
			@grid: the grid to be copied
		Return:
			newgrid: the grid copied
	makeMove: 
		Adds the intended piece to the grid
		Params:
			@grid: the current grid
			@color: the player color
			@moveL the drop move
		Return:
			Grid after drop move
	checkWin: 
		Checks if the move leads to a win condition:
		Params: 
			@grid: the current grid
		Returns:
			The winning condition if one exists else None
	checkWinColor: 
		Checks win condition for each color for the sake of simplicity. 
		params: 
			@color: the color to be checked
			@grid: the current grid
		return:
			win: win condition for the color in boolean
genRandomMove: 
		Generates move for the computer randomly (player 2)
		Params: 
			@grid: the current grid
		Returns: 
			A random move that is valid
	genMinMax: 
		Generates move base on min max algorithm and executes alpha beta pruning:
		Params: 	
			@grid: Grid of the game
			@playerno: the player value to determine the color piece for the computer
			@moves: the current streak of moves
			@depth: the depth bound for min max
			@alpha: the alpha for pruning
			@beta: the beta for pruning
			@maximizing: to check if we are in max or min state
		Returns
bestScoreAndMove: a tuple that contains the best score and the best move for recursive purposes. 
allPossibleMoves: 
	Params:
		@grid: The current grid state
	Returns:
		moves: a list of all possible valid moves in the grid. 
	
Pentago:
	Runs the game for the two players till there is a winner.
	Calls all the previous stated functions.
	Params: 
		@grid: the previous grid
		@p1: the player 1 name
		@p2: the player 2 name
		@userplayer: the choice of player the user wants to be
Problems:
	There are currently a lot of problems with the code. Mainly itâ€™s broken functionality of min max when ran with the game. The min max algorithm works alone with alpha beta pruning. The random algorithm still works.
